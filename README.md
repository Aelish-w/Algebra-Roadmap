# Ælish's Algebra Roadmap (Geometry and Structure Focused)

## Phase 1: Algebra via Geometry

- **Primary**: David Cox et al. — *Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms*
  - Concrete intro to polynomial rings, affine varieties, and Gröbner bases
  - Geometry-driven algebra

- **Supplement**: Joe Harris — *Algebraic Geometry: A First Course*
  - Geometric motivation for the structures of abstract algebra
  - Ideal for bridging to scheme theory and sheaf language later

## Phase 2: Category Theory as Abstraction

- **Primary**: Bartosz Milewski — *Category Theory for Programmers*
  - Reframe categories as generalized compile-time abstractions
  - Connect functors to transformations and trait lifting

- **Supplement**: Leinster — *Basic Category Theory*
  - Short, precise formal introduction if you want the clean math foundations

## Phase 3: Abstract Algebra (Structural View)

- **Skim as needed**: Dummit & Foote or Artin
  - Focus on material directly useful in AG or GA (modules, ideals, tensor products)
  - Skip rote exercises and build Obsidian notes structured around transformations and compositional systems

## Phase 4: Higher-Dimensional Algebra / Sheaves / Schemes

- **Optional**: Vakil’s *The Rising Sea* (start when you're ready)
  - Modern, category-theoretic foundation of algebraic geometry
  - Very long-term and deep, but brilliant

## Companion Projects
- Implement GA-style expression tree evaluators as category-inspired functor systems
- Visualize fiber bundles and sheaves using dataflow/dispatch metaphors
- Explore polynomial ring manipulation and algebraic variety plotting
